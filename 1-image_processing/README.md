# Image Processing Lab

Introduce key parts of the numpy and OpenCV APIs with an emphasis on applications in computational photography.

## Running the Notebook

Follow the [instructions](../README.md#Setup) for installing Anaconda and creating the CP environment. 

You can start the notebook server by executing `jupyter notebook` from the terminal. Copy the URL shown in the terminal into the address bar of a web browser to reach the notebook explorer which can be used to navigate to one of the notebook files (i.e., a file ending in ".ipynb").

You can edit code in any cell of the notebook, and execute each cell by clicking the "play" icon on the menu bar, or using the "shift + enter" keyboard shortcut. The output of each cell will appear inline in the notebook immediately after each cell.
